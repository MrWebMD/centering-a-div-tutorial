# centering-a-div-tutorial

Often times I hear the running joke about the challenges of centering a div. I have created this parody div centering tutorial. You can view the [live website](http://centeringthediv.mrwebmd.com), or perform this easy set up.

## Installation

Navigate to the root folder of the project and use the node package manager [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) to install all node dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

## Environment
This tutorial requires that a file named `.env` exists in the root directory of the project. Create a file named `.env` located at `/centering-a-div-tutorial/.env`. Next, replace the contents of the file with the template below.

```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3003
```
Once you've saved this, your environment is all set up!

## Usage
```
node index.js
```
